# Constructing-Risk-Profiles-for-Cervical-Cancer

Cervical cancer affects nearly 200,000 women per year in the United States alone. With the introduction of the HPV vaccine this number has gone down drastically, but it still remains prevalent and often goes undetected, especially in developing countries. In this project we aim to identify behavioral patterns that put women at a greater risk of contracting cervical cancer. We will use behavioral dataset that contains information about age, sexual health and results from four differ- ent diagnostic tests to predict the presence of cancerous cells in the cervix of a patient. Feature importance will be leveraged to construct risk profiles (high, low, medium risk) and validate our model against treatment schematics used by gynecologists as a course of action. Generation of such risk profiles will help healthcare institutions/doctors to identify at risk individuals who should receive immediate attention and a more tailored health plan.
